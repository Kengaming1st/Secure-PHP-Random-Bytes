Secure PHP random bytes
by @shoghicp

Useful for generating strong keys or random data. Better than default PHP random functions. Lots of different sources of entropy


Basic Usage: string randomBytes( [ int $lenght = 16 [, bool $secure = true [, bool $raw = true [, string $startEntropy = "" [, &$rounds ]]]]])

	$lenght = 16;
	$bytes = randomBytes($lenght, true, false); //This will return 32 secure hexadecimal characters
	$bytes = randomBytes($lenght, false, true); //This will return 16 binary characters
